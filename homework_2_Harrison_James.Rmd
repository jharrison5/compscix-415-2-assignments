<b>Excercise 3.2.4:</b><br>

1.I see a blank graph<br>
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```
<br><br>

2. MPG has 11 variable/rowss and 234 observations/rows<br>

3. drv means what type of drive train the vehicle has, front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, or 4 wheel drive.<br>

4. <br>
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```
<br>
<br>
5. <br>
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```
<br>this graph is not so useful since the scatter plot doesn't lend itself to displaying groupings. What I really want to see is what types of cars are rwd, fwd, etc. - and it takes a while to determine that.<br><br>
